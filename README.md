# CharacterLib

A thing that lets you build a character. Set doll, set name, set stats.

A sub part of it will be for credit shit.

## Usage

Ahahahahah. No.

## Features and bugs

I really don't expect ppl to use this besides me.

It should let you render a form to any sub project that lets ppl create a simple Char.

It has a sub section specifically for Credits.

It should also let you render all characters as a canvas (along with doll avatars).
