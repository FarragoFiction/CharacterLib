# CreditsLib

A thing to make giving people credit for helping easier to do. Includes a form to let ppl submit a bunch of info that then get serialized to a data string.

## Usage

Ahahahahah. No.

## Features and bugs

I really don't expect ppl to use this besides me.

It should let you render a form to any sub project that lets ppl submit Credits data.

It should also let you render all credits as html (along with doll avatars).
